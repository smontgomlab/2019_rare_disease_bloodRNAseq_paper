This repository contains the code used to generate results presented in "Identification of rare-disease genes using blood transcriptome sequencing and large control cohorts"

You can use our proposed pipeline to highlight candidate genes by following this [code](./pipeline.md)

You can find the code and data to reproduce the main figures [here](https://github.com/lfresard/blood_rnaseq_rare_disease_paper/blob/master/main_figures)

You can find the code and data to reproduce the Extended Data Figures [here](https://github.com/lfresard/blood_rnaseq_rare_disease_paper/blob/master/sup_figures)
